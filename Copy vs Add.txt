Difference Between COPY and ADD in Dockerfile**

In Docker, both **COPY** and **ADD** are used to bring files into an image, but they serve different purposes.

**COPY** is the *simpler and more predictable* instruction.
It strictly copies files or directories from the build context into the image without performing any additional actions. Because of its simplicity and transparency, **COPY is generally the recommended instruction for most use cases**.

**ADD**, on the other hand, is more powerful.
In addition to copying files, it can also **automatically extract tar archives** and **fetch files from remote URLs**. While these capabilities can be useful, they also introduce implicit behavior. For example, a tar file added with ADD will be extracted automatically, which may not always be desirable. Due to this implicit behavior, Docker recommends using **ADD only when you specifically need its advanced features**.

**In summary:**

* Use **COPY** for standard file transfers because it is cleaner, more secure, and easier to maintain.
* Use **ADD** only when you require **automatic tar extraction** or **URL-based file retrieval**.

This demonstrates to the interviewer that you understand not just the difference, but also the *best practices* behind choosing one over the other.
